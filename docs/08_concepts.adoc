=== 8.2. Persistence

At the beginning there was a debate about whether it was better to use SQL or NoSQL for persistence. After some discussion it was concluded that the best option for this problem is NoSQL. To be more specific MongoDB, which is a NoSQL document database. We will use a NoSQL database as opposed to a SQL database, because our model encompasses many products. These products have several attributes which are very different. For example, a power supply differs in many ways from a graphics card. Because there are so many items, we believe it is best to use a NoSQL DB.

=== 8.3. User interface_

_DeDe user interface is desinged to give every user an intuitive and familiar experience related using the React framework combined with TypeScript as constraints. We follow the usual standards of e-commerce online sites to make the navigation closer to what most of the people already know. Also, the interface is meant to pass the AAA validation so we make sure it's usable for almost everyone_

=== 8.4. Internazionalization

The application will potentially deal with various locations and people, so make a multi-language application looks like the best decision. This decision must be done since the begining of the desing (lately will cost a lot of resources).

This allows us to reach a bigger audience and make the application more accesible.


=== 8.5. Security

Security is a key aspect of our software (and almost all) project. We will follow SOLID as recommendation to store our customers data and we will manage the data base to be always in a consistent state.


=== 8.6. Additional libraries

TODO


=== 8.7. Archiutecture and design patterns

TODO


=== 8.8 Code Quality standards

Code quality standars allows us to make an understable, maintainable and reusable code for future revisions and changes. Code should always have a correct structure to be easily understandable.

To achieve this we will use all tools programs give us and make correct decisions like design patters, use convention naming and try to reduce technical debt.

=== 8.9. Testability

Applications should be strongly tested. We will use user histories to make acceptance tests and unit test to test the rest of the application components and states during running process.

We think this is the best way to be sure the project works correctly.
